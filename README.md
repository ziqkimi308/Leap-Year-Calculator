# Leap Year Calculator

- This project calculates whether a given year is a leap year or not. It uses basic conditional statements to check the divisibility rules for leap years, providing a simple and accurate result.

---

### How it Works?:

- The program prompts the user to input a year.
- It then checks the following conditions:
  - Divisible by 4: A year must be divisible by 4 to be considered a leap year.
  - Divisible by 100: However, if the year is also divisible by 100, it is not a leap year unless:
  - Divisible by 400: If the year is divisible by 400, it is a leap year.
- Based on these conditions, the program determines whether the year is a leap year or not.
